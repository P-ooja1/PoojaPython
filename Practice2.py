#Print characters from a string that are present at an even index number

# x = input("Enter the string value")

# Write a program to remove characters from a string starting from zero up to n and return a new string.

# n =input("Enter the value to remove")
# print(n[2:])

# Write a function to return True if the first and last number of a given list is same.
# If numbers are different then return False.

#IterIterate the given list of numbers and print only those numbers which are divisible by 5

# a = [10,20,85,99,66,5,30,55]
# for i in a :
#     if  i % 5 == 0 :
#         print(i)
#     else :
#         print("NF")

# Return the count of a given substring from a string

# x = input("Enter the value to find repeated words")
# y = x.count('is')
# print(y)

# pattern

# for i in range(8) :
#     for j in range(i) :
#         print(i,end=" ")
#     print("\n")


# Given a two list of numbers, write a program to create a new list
# such that the new list should contain odd numbers from the first list and
# even numbers from the second list.

# a= []
# b = [10,11,13,14,20]
# c = [5,20,30,40,85]
# for i in b :
#     if i % 2 != 0 :
#         a.append(i)
# for i in c :
#     if i % 2 == 0 :
#         a.append(i)
# print(a)

# doubt  Write a Program to extract each digit from an integer in the reverse order.
# For example, If the given int is 7536, the output shall be “6 3 5 7“, with a space separating the digits.
